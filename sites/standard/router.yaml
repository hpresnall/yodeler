uplink:
  # could also use static IP addresses here for ISPs that provide them
  ipv4_address: dhcp
  # request a DHCP6 address in addtion to SLAAC and DHCP6 options
  ipv6_dhcp: true
  # request an IPv6 prefix delegation of this length
  # this will be distributed to the vlans, possibly using the ipv6_pd_network setting 
  ipv6_pd_prefixlen: 56
  # note that eth0 _cannot_ also be an uplink for a vswitch
  # this interface is dedicated to the router by the KVM host using macvtap
  # could also set vswitch + vlan here instead of macvtap
  # this would require a separate vswitch just for the router
  macvtap: eth0
# not on the mgmt vlan for security
# if desired anyway, that interface would need to be manually added since it is not routable
